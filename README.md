# Discord-Bot

This is my discord bot that uses the Discord.js module. 
Its main purpose at the moment is to provide recommendations for music and anime. It also makes administration easier through commands that save time.

- is the preset prefix for commands, and -help will bring up the command list for the user.

Thank you to Discord.js for the great module and code for getting the bot up and running.
